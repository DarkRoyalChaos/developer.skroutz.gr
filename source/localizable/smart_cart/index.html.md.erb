# Overview <%= edit_link %>

There are currently two tools for Merchants that can be used to integrate Smart Cart orders
into their existing system, the [Orders API](/smart_cart/orders_api) and
[Webhooks](/smart_cart/webhooks).

<%= partial 'partials/toc' %>

## Orders API

Orders API allows Skroutz Merchants to perform actions on their Smart Cart orders,
such as accepting or rejecting an order.

[Orders API documentation](/smart_cart/orders_api)

## Webhooks

Webhook allows Skroutz Merchants to automatically receive order details to their
platform when a new Smart Cart order is placed or an existing one is updated.

[Webhooks documentation](/smart_cart/webhooks)

## Use cases

Both [Webhooks](/smart_cart/webhooks) and [Orders API](/smart_cart/orders_api) can be enabled and
used separately. For a full orders integration though, it would require to implement both services,
since Webhooks can be utilized to get notified about new orders (or order updates) and the Orders
API can be used to interact with that orders later on.

An order coming through a Webhook event has a unique `code`. You can use this code to
perform the API requests for that specific order.

#### Rejecting orders

<pre>
— User places an order on Skroutz
→ [Webhook] Your website gets a "new_order" payload, including the available options to accept or reject the order
  — The stock of the product is checked, and there is limited stock for an item
  ← [Orders API] Your website issues a "reject" request, indicating the line item and the available stock
    — Skroutz reprocesses the order (your website could receive a new order for the available items)
</pre>

#### Accepting orders

<pre>
— User places an order on Skroutz
→ [Webhook] Your website gets a "new_order" payload, including the available options to accept or reject the order
  - The stock of the product is checked, and the order can be processed
  ← [Orders API] Your website issues an "accept" request to the to accept the order
    — Skroutz processes the order and creates the courier voucher
      → [Webhook] Your website gets an "order_updated" payload, including the courier voucher (PDF)
      — The courier voucher gets printed
</pre>
