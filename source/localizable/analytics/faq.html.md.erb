# FAQ <%= edit_link %>

Will adding this script affect the performance of my website?
: No, we've put a lot of effort, and used some of the most cutting edge
techniques to make sure that our script runs sandboxed without affecting the
experience of your users.

What kind of info is emitted from this script?
: We take user privacy seriously. The data retained by our service remains
anonymous, and are neither exposed or sold to 3rd parties. The script reports
actions that you explicitly define with commands in your website.

Where can I view the source of this script?
: The script is open sourced on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/skroutz/analytics.js).
Feel free to create issues there, or even contribute.

What about browser support?
: The script is tested to work on all modern browsers: Internet Explorer > 6, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari.

How can I confirm that the script is sending data properly?
: Currently there is no way to check whether the script is reporting properly. Please, after you add the script,
contact us and we will check if the script is installed correcly. In the meantime we are working hard to bring
you information about the intregration status and reports.
