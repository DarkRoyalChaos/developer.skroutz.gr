# Analytics <%= edit_link %>

Analytics is a project to measure how users interact with partners websites.

<%= partial 'partials/toc' %>

## Quick Start

To successfully report your sales insights you have to add the following
JavaScript snippet and declare actions, at least inside the page which informs
the user that the order is completed (eg. "Thank You" page).

You may add the snippet just before closing either the `<head>` or `<body>`
section.

###### Tracking Code JS Snippet

<%= render_code_from_file "analytics/#{flavor}/js_snippet" %>

> ##### Note
> You **have to** replace the `'SA-XXXX-YYYY'` property with the actual
*Shop Account ID* you received from us.

## Next Steps

  * <%= link_to 'Analytics Settings', '/analytics/settings' %>
