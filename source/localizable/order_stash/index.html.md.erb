# Save Your Order <%= edit_link %>

"Save Your Order" service helps you increase the number of Shop Reviews in <%= flavor.capitalize %>.

<%= partial 'partials/toc' %>

## How It Looks

<%= image_tag "/assets/images/#{flavor}/order_stash/widget_preview.gif", class: 'order-stash-preview' %>

## How It Works

After completing their purchases, customers are prompted to save their order, through a widget on the checkout page.

After that:

- Customers are able to view their saved orders from your store, through their <%= settings.site_name.capitalize %>
  account.
- In regards to any saved orders, **an email is sent** to customers, asking them to write a **review**,
  sharing their experience.

## Integration

"Save Your Order" service requires only to have [Analytics](/analytics) integrated into your store
properly.

#### When widget is displayed

"Save Your Order" widget *pops up* when a completed [order](/analytics/ecommerce/#addorder) is reported
through [Analytics](/analytics).

## Settings

"Save Your Order" service's configuration is **only** available through
[Merchants control panel](https://<%= settings.merchants_domain %>/services/order_stash/).
